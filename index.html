            <h3>What genre of creative software does it belong to?</h3>
            <p> Orb Farm is part of the Sandbox Simulation genre of creative software.
                 Players are able to experiment with eco systems interact with environmental ecosystems, 
                 using different elements.</p>
<h4>Similar software in this genre</h4>
<ul><li>
    SimEarth – A classic planet simulation game where players control ecosystems and climate to shape a living world
</li>
<li> Noita – A physics-based rogue-lite where every pixel is simulated, allowing for dynamic environmental interactions.</li>
<li>Terrarium: Landfall – A relaxing ecosystem simulation where players cultivate plants and balance environmental conditions.</li></ul>

<h5>The program's interactive features/mechanics 
</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Placement Of Elements - audience has the ability to add or remove the elements provided by the game. Such as stone, wood, grass, sand and algae.</li>
    <li>Maintaining the ecosystem – In order to maintain the ecosystem players of the game must make sure there is enough food oxygen, food and population.</li>
</ul>

<h5>What features/mechanics indicate its genre by aligning with its conventions?</h5>
<p>Orb.Farm is part of the sandbox simulation genre due to its features of interaction that emphasize experimentation. 
    The ecosystem creation being open ended lets players place elements. 
    Its real-time ecological interactions, such as predator-prey relationships, oxygen cycling,
     and decomposition are similar feature found in simulation games. 
    The game has no clear objectives, which allows players to observe and experiment, a defining trait of sandbox experiences. </p></div>
   
    <div class="right">
    <h5>What features/mechanics are novel for its genre?</h5>
    <p>What sets Orb.Farm apart from average sandbox simulation games is its fully self-contained ecosystem, where players must carefully balance oxygen, nutrients, and species survival without external interference. While sandbox games usually allow an infinite number of resources. 
        The game also has a minimalist simulation that is scientifically accurate at the same time, adding a education component to it as well. </p></div>

        <div id="up"><h3>What features/mechanics common to its genre are missing or might be added?</h3>
        <p>Some of the features that it lacks are the weather factors, including temperature levels, rain, and changes in seasons, that could then change the environment of the game. There could also be a more variety of different types of sea creatures within the game. Such as Octopus, Jelly fish or Whales.</p></div>
<h3>What context, community or niche is it primarily aimed at and what indicates this?</h3>
<p>The primary target for Orb farm is gamers that are usually interested in sandbox simulations. Orb.Farm will appeal to fans of sandbox simulations because it offers a highly interactive, open-ended environment where players can experiment, observe, and shape their own virtual ecosystem. Another group will be people interested in environmental science. because it allows players to explore interactively real-world environmental principles in virtual ecosystem.</p>
<h3>What did you find annoying and/or boring about interacting with it?</h3>
<p>Aspects that make the game feel limiting or frustrating, would be the lack of visuals to track data such as oxygen levels, population trends, or nutrient cycles, making it difficult understand how to manage the ecosystem. </p>
